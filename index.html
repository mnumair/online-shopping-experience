        Dr. Imran Murtaza, Prof. Dr. Ahmed Shuja and Centre for Advanced Electronics & Photovoltaic Engineering (CAEPE) have brought an honor to the International Islamic University by winning yet another international R&D grant from HEC and British Council. The project is aimed to engineer the Energy harvesters and develop the Self-charging power packs with the potential to revolutionize wearable technology and electric cars. This new technology is well-aligned with the energy priority area of both Pakistan and the UK, and will enable to enhance and improve the performance of current technology such as health, environment and food quality monitoring, smart cities and buildings, transportation, sport activities, space expeditions and military devices.<br/>
        Only 6 projects were finally awarded in Pak UK Gateway ICRG funding call, out of over 263 projects jointly submitted from Pakistan and UK, with an international peer review spanning over a year in three different stages. The overall tune of the funds in this project is almost Rs. 100 Million (UK £ 500,000) with half of it for the IIU team. The project was pitched from the Centre for Advanced Electronics & Photovoltaic Engineering, and will be housed in CAEPE with its dedicated facility utilization, and an extension laboratory created in the Department of Physics in the university. This prestigious international grant is also a recognition of Prof. Shuja’s and Dr. Imran’s earlier scientific work on supercapacitors and next generation of batteries funded by Pakistan Science Foundation and National Science Foundation of China.

        Environmental scientists are spilling oil at a freshwater research facility in northwestern Ontario to test the waters for non-invasive cleanup techniques.

The Experimental Lakes Area, which is operated by the Winnipeg-based International Institute of Sustainable Development, consists of 58 small lakes and their watersheds. The natural laboratory is used by scientists who undertake real-world experiments on freshwater lakes to better understand wetlands and the impact people have on them.

The facility’s latest one-of-a-kind project has researchers conducting controlled oil spills and exploring ways to use bacteria in the wetlands to clean them up by turning oil into carbon dioxide and water, it announced Friday.
